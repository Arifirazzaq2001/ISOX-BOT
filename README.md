## Welcome to ISOX-BOT Official page

Here I want to give my own WhatsApp bot script, and you can use it for free, with a homemade base called [ISOX BOT](https://github.com/Arifirazzaq2001/ISOX-BOT)

And Please Appreciate This WhatsApp Bot Script I Made, Because I'm A Self-taught Programmer.

### How to Run it

To run the WhatsApp bot, you can click on one of the platforms below to deploy

_______________________
##### Deploy To Heroku

##### Deploy To Railway
[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template?template=https://github.com/Arifirazzaq2001/ISOX-BOT)

In addition to the above platforms, you can run bots specifically using RDP/PC/COMPUTER. 
and for platforms, look for support such as Debian/Linux/Ubuntu and so on.
